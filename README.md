A Knative Load Test Tool

**Please NOTE this project is under rapid development**.
Kperf is designed for Knative Load test. It helps to generate workload like Knative services and 
gives measurement result about underneath resource create time duration based on server side timestamps, 
and give statics and raw measurement result, to help Knative developers or operators to figure out Knative platform
stability, scalability and performance bottleneck.


# Usage
## Build and install kperf
```cassandraql
# format and build kperf
$ cd {workspace}/src/knative.dev/kperf
$ go get -u github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata/...
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
$ ./hack/build.sh

# Move kperf
$ mv kperf /usr/local/bin/
```

Note: [go-bindata](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata) is required in the build process.

## Knative Serving load test

Kperf can help to generate Knative Service Deployment Load in your Knative platform. We assume you have created a
Kubernetes cluster and deployed [Knative Serving](https://knative.dev/docs/install/). 

### Prepare namespaces
Please note that by default kperf assumes you have prepared K8s namespace(s) to create Knative Service. 
If namespace doesn't exist, create it with kubectl as below

```shell script
# Create a namespace for kperf to create Services in it
kubectl create ns {namespace-name}

# Create namespaces from test-1 to test-10 for kperf to create Services distributed in them
for name in {1..10};do kubectl create ns test-$name;done
```

### generate Knative Service deployment load
```shell script
# Generate total 30 knative service, for each 15 seconds create 10 ksvc with 5 concurrency in namespace test-1, test-2
# and test-3, and the ksvc names are ktest-0, ktest-1.....ktest-29.
$ kperf service generate -n 30 -b 10 -c 5 -i 15 --namespace-prefix test --namespace-range 1,3 --svc-prefix ktest --max-scale 1 --min-scale 1

Creating ksvc ktest-0 in namespace test-1
Creating ksvc ktest-1 in namespace test-2
...
...
Creating ksvc ktest-29 in namespace test-3
```

```shell script
# Generate total 30 knative service, for each 15 seconds create 10 ksvc with 1 concurrency in namespace test1, test2 and
# test3, and the ksvc names are ktest-0, ktest-2.....ktest-29. The generation will wait the previous generated service
# to be ready for most 10 seconds.
$ kperf service generate -n 30 -b 10 -c 5 -i 15 --namespace-prefix test --namespace-range 1,3 --svc-prefix ktest --wait --timeout 10s --max-scale 1 --min-scale 1

Creating ksvc ktests-0 in namespace test-1
Creating ksvc ktests-1 in namespace tes-2
...
...
Creating ksvc ktests-29 in namespace test-3
```

### Measure Knative Service deployment time
- Service Configurations Duration Measurement: time duration for Knative Configurations to be ready
- Service Routes Duration Measurement: time duration for Knative Routes to be ready
- Overall Service Ready Measurement: time duration for Knative Service to be ready

Here is a figure of different resources generated for a Knative Service(assuming Istio is the network solution).
![resources created by Knative Service](docs/service_creation.png)

**Example 1 Measure Services (for eg. range 1,500)for load test under a specific namespace**

```shell script
$ kperf service measure --namespace ktest-1 --svc-prefix ktest --range 0,9  --verbose --output /tmp

### Clean Knative Service generated for test
```shell script
# Delete all ksvc with name prefix ktest in namespaces with name prefix test and index 1,2,3
$ kperf service clean --namespace-prefix test --namespace-range 1,3 --svc-prefix ktest

Delete ksvc ktest-0 in namespace test-1
Delete ksvc ktest-2 in namespace test-1
...
Delete ksvc ktests-1 in namespace test-2

...
Delete ksvc ktests-5 in namespace test-3
Delete ksvc ktests-8 in namespace test-3
```

### Analyze load test result through Dashboard

A visualized result is automatically generated by kperf during the measurement step to make the measurement data to be intuitive, which is a static HTML file including a chart and a table.

![service_creation_duration measurement](docs/kperf_dashboard.png)

As we will have tons of measurement metrics for a single test (e.g. `revision_ready`, `configuration_ready`, `ingress_ready` and etc.), itâ€™s important to pick some key measurement metrics to analyze the bottleneck of the Knative service creation lifecycle.

The kperf dashboard enables to select or unselect the metrics to be observed, that will be much easier for developers to find out the most time consuming operations during the service creation. Besides, the kperf dashboard supports zooming in/out the data, developers can choose the full set of the data or only a subset of the data to observe.

The kperf dashboard is built based on an open source charting library [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html), we are taking advantage of the rich features provided by this library, and also extend it's functionality by implementing some custom tools.

Detailed description about the usage of the kperf dashboard:

1. **Select Data Source** : choose another CSV file from local to be rendered in the page.

2. **Value** : hover on the chart area to see detailed metric values under the same x axis.

3. **Legend** : click on the legend to show/hide the metric line/bar in the chart. Metrics are auto-grouped by it's name prefix before the `_` symbol, e.g. in this sample chart, metrics `ingress_ready` `ingress_config_ready` and `ingress_lb_ready` are grouped together and assigned with a group icon âœ¤.

4. Toolbox **Select/Unselect All** : click on 'select/unselect all' icon of the toolbox to show/hide all of the metric lines/bars in the chart.

5. Toolbox **Select Group** : click on any 'group' icon of the toolbox to show the metric lines/bars under the target group in the chart and hide others.

6. Toolbox **Switch Chart Type** : switch chart type between `line` and `bar`, `staked bar` and `unstacked bar`, `tiled line` and `untiled line`.

7. Toolbox **Data Zoom** : enable to select a specific area to be zoomed in/out.

8. Toolbox **Restore** : restore to initial chart configuration after switching chart type, data zooming and etc.

9. Toolbox **Data View** : display raw data in current chart and update chart after being edited.

10. Toolbox **Save as Image** : save current chart view as an image.
